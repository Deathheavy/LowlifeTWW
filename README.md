# LowlifeTWW

About

This is a simple addon for The War Within to play a sound when your health is below a default or configured threshhold. It saves the configured treshhold if you change the default one. I made this addon for myself because i'm learning to code and I decided that WoW is a good place to practice, after I finished testing and saw that it was working, I decided to make it public because even though I know that it is possible to do the same functionality in other ways in the game, I did not find any addon of this type for the current version of the game.

 

Commands

You can change the default threshold that is 30% by typing /lowlife 0 - 100

 

Sound

By default it is playing the Tom and Jerry scream in the master volume channel, to change the sound you simple need to pick your desired sound and put in World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\LowlifeTWW and name it defaultsound.mp3
